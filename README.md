3-Tier-Registration-Form.net
============================

This is a small software in .NET framework 4.0.It is compatible in all browsers. 

 PLEASE NOTE :
 
 Please add references of layers in all project otherwise some namespaces will not work.
 
 GOALS:
* Scalability— Each tier can scale horizontally. For example, you can load-balance the Presentation tier among three servers to satisfy more Web requests without adding servers to the Application and Data tiers.
* Performance— Because the Presentation tier can cache requests, network utilization is minimized, and the load is reduced on the Application and Data tiers. If needed, you can load-balance any tier.
* Availability— If the Application tier server is down and caching is sufficient, the Presentation tier can process Web requests using the cache.

Current features:
* Easy to register a form without not much complexity.
* Facility to see the complete user details in Grid View.
* Paging in Grid View for multiple records.
* Last but not the least using 3 tier architecture.
